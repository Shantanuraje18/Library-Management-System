# 📚 Library Management System (C-Based)

A CLI-based (Command Line Interface) application developed in **C** to automate the day-to-day operations of a library.

### 💻 Core Features
* **File-Based Storage:** Utilizes C's file handling (`fopen`, `fwrite`, `fread`) to ensure data persists after the program closes.
* **Data Structures:** Implements `structs` to manage book attributes like ID, Title, Author, and Availability.
* **Search Logic:** Includes custom algorithms to search for books by their unique ID or Name.
* **Transaction Management:** Logic for issuing and returning books with real-time record updates.
